# Level Thumbnails
Mod => https://github.com/cdc-sys/level-thumbnails

This is just a custom backend that doesn't use Discord and that supports approval/denial messages via GD's DM system :)

BTW, you need to put isAdmin.php in the same directory as your GDPS' uploadGJMessage20.php

Creds to MegaSa1nt & Cvolton for the DM xor etc :)
